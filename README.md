# Timestamp Microservice

This project is based on the boilerplate code provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice) for the Timestamp Microservice project.  

The code is distributed under the MIT License, which allows for modification, distribution, and use of the code. In this project, I have made customizations—including updates to the CSS and other modifications—while maintaining proper credit to the original source.
